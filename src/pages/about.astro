    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      OpenPhones is a small project made for the purpose of getting more people
      truly private and secure phones. To accomplish this, we only sell phones
      that still receive full security updates, with an operating system (OS)
      that provides meaningful privacy and security benefits, sold at a minimal
      markup, in addition to providing international shipping options. We also
      offer a hidden service and an option to pay with Monero, as to offer
      anonymity for those who require it.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
      Localhost had the idea for OpenPhones in early March, after being inspired
      by how absolutely horrendous the de-Googled phone market is. The majority
      of retailers are selling phones at nearly double the market value, on
      end-of-life (EOL) devices, with OSs that are neither private nor secure.
      And according to the GrapheneOS team, out of all of the retailers that do
      ship phones with GrapheneOS, only 1 donates back to the project. With this
      in mind, he wanted to make a project that did the exact opposite. He
      decided to only sell phones that receive full security updates, that ship
      with a truly private and secure OS, at a mininal markup, all while
      donating back to the project that truly protects users privacy and
      security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Work on OpenPhones began in late March of 2023, with Localhost drawing his
      vision for the website on a borrowed piece of paper from a hotel lobby,
      about to leave for a cruise. He had discussed his plans earlier with his
      friend Mester, and he had offered to help build the site. Around that
      time, a fellow by the name of noClaps had also offered to work on the
      site. After a careful 2 seconds of consideration, Localhost sent him a
      picture of that piece of paper, and Mester and noClaps started work on the
      site.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the site is live, and almost ready for our first sale. In the future,
      we're hoping to keep 3-4 phones of each model in stock so we can cut down
      on shipping time. We're also hoping to add trade-ins and repair options to
      make it even easier to obtain a GrapheneOS phone and make it last. Our end
      goal by implementing all of this to help more people in and out of the
      privacy circle easily obtain a GrapheneOS phone, so that they can take the
      next step in their privacy journey. Thank you for supporting OpenPhones
      and helping us achieve that!
