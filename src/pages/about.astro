        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <!-- <p>
            Welcome to OpenPhones, your destination for an effortless,
            low-cost, and private way to obtain a GrapheneOS phone and support
            the project. Our mission is to offer you an alternative to the
            overpriced and insecure options currently available on the market.
        </p>

        <p>
            We pride ourselves on being different from other providers. Unlike
            Nitrophone, we don't charge double MSRP for a phone that has useless
            hardware removals. And unlike some others, we won't sell you a phone
            that doesn't receive full security updates and runs on an insecure
            operating system that lacks important privacy features.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are committed to transparency and privacy, and we offer a hidden
            service and a private way to pay via Monero for those who require
            anonymity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our team consists of dedicated individuals who are passionate about
            privacy and security. Our front-end developer, Noclaps, is a
            19-year-old from India who uses a Graphene OS phone, likes drawing,
            and can sing Hamilton songs pretty well. Our back-end developer,
            Mester, is a 15-year-old from Hungary who used to be a god-tier
            Minecraft player and is now an expert in various coding languages.
            He keeps our localhost focused and is essentially the co-CEO of
            OpenPhones.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, there's localhost, our founder and CEO. He's a 17-year-old
            from the US who uses a Graphene OS phone and is an aspiring CCNA. He
            enjoys mountain biking and debunking Rob Braxman.
        </p>

        <p>
            At OpenPhones.global, we are committed to supporting the Graphene OS
            project by donating 20% of our profits back to the organization. We
            provide clear breakdowns of our pricing, our front-end and back-end
            processes, and the use cases and limitations of our site.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for choosing OpenPhones.global as your source for a
            low-cost, private, and transparent Graphene OS phone.

        <p>
            Here at OpenPhones, we believe that privacy and security are basic
            human rights. Everyone deserves a way to escape the monetization of
            personal data done by the surveillance capitalist megacorporations
            of today's world. This is why we started OpenPhones, with a goal to
            provide an affordable, transparent, and privacy way to obtain
            GrapheneOS phones to as many people as possible.
        </p>
